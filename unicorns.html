          <p class="content">
            The Holstein breed itself has been one of the best show jumping and eventing breeds in the world for decades. In addition, Holstein genetics also serve as the basis for success in numerous other show jumping breeds. In almost 150 years of breeding history, Holstein breeders have succeeded in developing the former commercial horse into a high-performance sport partner.In doing so, a clear breeding goal is pursued: A correct, typeful, modern and particularly powerful horse for top sport is bred, which is able to cope with the increased technical requirements in jumping and eventing. With its effective movement and a clear canter, it is also desired for the higher dressage sport. As a matter of principle, animal welfare is given high priority in all selection decisions based on the above-mentioned breeding objective.

            Knabstrupper horses are a relatively new breed in the U.S, as it was not until 2002 that they arrived from Europe. However, their origins, thanks to cave paintings, trace back to the prehistoric spotted equines native to today’s Spain.The modern Knabstrupper developed in Denmark in 1812 after breeding a chestnut mare with complex leopard markings known as Flaebehoppen to a solid-colored Frederiksborg stallion.

          <p class="content">
            The Lipizzaner horse is one of the oldest breeds in Europe. The breed got its start in 1580 when Archduke Charles of the Austro-Hungrian Empire established a stud farm at Lipizza near the Adriatic Sea in modern day Slovenia. This occurred shortly after his brother, Maximilian II, had imported Spanish horses to Austria and founded the court stud at Kladrub. It was from the stud farm at Lipizza that the breed gets its name. Archduke Charles greatly desired to create a horse that was not only suited for war, but also for pulling carriages and performing in the manner of classical riding. The Renaissance had brought with it a rejuvenation of classical art and horsemanship was no exception.Riding was raised to an art form and became a necessary area of study for any nobleman.

          <p class="content">
            Trakehner breeding originated in East Prussia in the thirteenth century when the Teutonic Knights colonised the land – and with it the hardy local Schweiken horse.In 1732 the Friedrich Wilhelm II ordered the establishment of the Royal Stud at Trakehnen. The early products were not impressive and in 1787, the newly appointed head of the stud, Graf Lindenau culled 25 of the existing 38 stallions, and 144 of the 381 broodmares, remarking that they were ‘not lean and strong boned enough, moved too narrow in the hindequarters and there were too many curbs; some horses were eliminated because they were suspected of having spavins and some had boxy hooves.’
